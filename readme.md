This is my implementation of the photoshare project. It's a simple Flikr/Google Photos application that allows you to post photos to albums, like and tag photos.

To run:
	
	git clone https://github.com/sean-smith/photoshare
	cd photoshare
	pip install -r requirements.txt
	python app.py
	
Then go to https://localhost:5000 to check it out!

Note, you'll need a mysql db instance running for this to work.
